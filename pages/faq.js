                What is accessibility?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                This article starts off the module with a good look at what
                accessibility is — this includes what groups of people we need to
                consider and why, what tools different people use to interact with
                the web, and how we can make accessibility part of our web
                development workflow.

                HTML: A good basis for accessibility?

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making
                sure the correct HTML elements are always used for the correct
                purpose.

                CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to
                allow for accessible web experiences, but if misused they can
                significantly harm accessibility. This article outlines some CSS
                and JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure
                that even complex content is as accessible as possible.

                Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex
                UI controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic
                JavaScript-updated content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a
                technology that can help with such problems by adding in further
                semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize
                and use to let users know what is going on. Here we'll show how to
                use it at a basic level to improve accessibility.

                Accessible multimedia?

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Another category of content that can create accessibility problems
                is multimedia — video, audio, and image content need to be given
                proper textual alternatives, so they can be understood by
                assistive technologies and their users. This article shows how.
